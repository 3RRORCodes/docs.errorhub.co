### REFUND POLICY
{% endhint %}

* If the request is made on the grounds that the user wanted an open-source (unescrowed) version of the script but it is encrypted (escrowed), refunds will not be given. This is clearly explained in our store, which lists the resources that are encrypted and those that are not.
* If you are using an unsupported framework, experience problems because you have made personal modifications to the script, or use custom scripts other than the original QBCore that aren't working properly, we can't process refunds.
* If you choose not to install the required dependencies and the script does not function, you will not be eligible for a refund.
* However, a refund will be started if there is a demonstrated issue with our resources.
