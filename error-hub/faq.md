<summary><strong>What is Escrowed in FiveM?</strong></summary>

In FiveM, "escrowed" means some parts of a script are locked and can't be changed or seen by anyone except the creator. This is done to protect the script and make sure no one copies it or messes with it.\
Even though the script is locked, it can still be used on a server, but people can't access or edit the hidden parts of the code. This helps developers keep their work safe while still letting others use it.

**Example:**\
Imagine you buy a script for your server, like a special car mod. The creator of the mod locks some parts of the car's code so no one can steal it or change how it works. You can still add the car to your server and use it, but you canâ€™t see or change how the car's special features are built. This way, the creator's work stays safe.
