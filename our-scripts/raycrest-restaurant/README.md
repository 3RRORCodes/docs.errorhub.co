# Raycrest Restaurant

A unique stingray-shaped oceanfront restaurant set along Del Perro Beach. The build uses a warm bamboo and wood style, creating a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere for both daytime RP and evening hangouts. The open layout gives players plenty of good angles for photos, sea views, and social RP moments.
