# Codekit

A versatile toolkit that helps streamline and manage the core functions of our scripts. **eh\_codekit** acts as a bridge library and utility tool, connecting different systems and making it easier to organize, configure, and maintain our scripts. Currently, itâ€™s only used as a dependency for our internal projects.
